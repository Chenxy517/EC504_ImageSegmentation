# EC504_ImageSegmentation

## Description

Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which corresponds to a different object or part of the image.This is an important task in computer vision and image processing, as it enables the extraction of relevant information from images for further analysis and manipulation.

Image segmentation has various applications, including object detection and recognition, image editing, medical imaging, and video analysis. In video analysis, image segmentation can be used to track objects over time and analyze their motion and behavior.

Our project aims at trying to use Graph Cut alogorithm to solve this problem, and we also use K-means method, GMM(Gaussian Mixture Model) to handle this problem. Then comparing the results generated by different algorithms and analyse them.
